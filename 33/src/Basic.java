        // src(LHS) > Right click (new) > java class > give name for class > enter)

    // We create as many class as we want in same project but we have to also create main class with main method to run all
                             // these classes (i.e in main class all other classes run)

    //Double click on above first or any classname.java we get enough space and then again double click on it we get side window to create new class

    //Shortcut to create new class in project view > tools windows > project > the line 6

    //Sab class alag alag window me hote hai.......2 class ek hee window me nahi aa sakte
